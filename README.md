## The Problem We Solve

AI-assisted coding is revolutionary, but it comes with a challenge: **How do you maintain control and quality standards when an AI is making rapid changes to your codebase?**

Without guardrails, Claude Code sessions can:
- Break existing linting and formatting rules
- Create files in wrong locations
- Skip essential validation steps
- Leave your project in an inconsistent state
- Bypass your carefully crafted development workflows

**conclaude changes this story.**

## How conclaude Changes Everything

Imagine starting every Claude Code session knowing that:

‚úÖ **Your linting rules will be respected** - No more broken formatting or style violations  
‚úÖ **Your tests must pass** - Sessions only complete when your test suite is green  
‚úÖ **Your files stay organized** - No mysterious root-level files cluttering your project  
‚úÖ **Your workflows are enforced** - Build processes, validation, and quality checks run automatically  
‚úÖ **Everything is configurably logged** - Complete visibility into what Claude did during each session  

This isn't just wishful thinking‚Äîit's what conclaude delivers every single time.

## What Makes conclaude Different

While other tools try to bolt-on AI safety as an afterthought, conclaude was built from the ground up specifically for Claude Code workflows. Here's what sets it apart:

üéØ **Purpose-Built for Claude Code**: Native integration with Claude's lifecycle hooks‚Äîno hacks, no workarounds  
‚ö° **Zero Configuration Friction**: Simple YAML config that just works, powered by cosmiconfig  
üõ°Ô∏è **Fail-Fast Protection**: Catches problems immediately, not after damage is done  
üîÑ **Extensible Hook System**: Handle PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, and more lifecycle events  
üìä **Session-Aware Logging**: Every action is tracked with session context for complete auditability  

## Core Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Hook System**: Handle all Claude Code lifecycle events with precision
- **YAML Configuration**: Human-readable configuration that scales with your team
- **Command Execution**: Run your existing lint, test, and build commands automatically
- **File Protection**: Prevent unwanted file creation with intelligent pattern matching
- **Session Logging**: Winston-based logging with session-specific file output
- **Infinite Monitoring**: Optional continuous monitoring for long-running development sessions

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The "Oops, My Tests Are Broken" Prevention

**Before conclaude:**
```
Developer: "Claude, add user authentication to my app"
Claude: *writes beautiful auth code*
Developer: *tries to deploy*
CI/CD: ‚ùå 47 test failures, linting errors everywhere
Developer: *spends 2 hours fixing what should have been caught*
```

**With conclaude:**
```
Developer: "Claude, add user authentication to my app"
Claude: *writes beautiful auth code*
conclaude: ‚úÖ All tests pass, linting clean
Developer: *deploys confidently*
```

### Scenario 2: The "Where Did This File Come From?" Mystery

**The Problem:**
You're reviewing Claude's work and find `config.json`, `temp.js`, and `debug.log` scattered in your project root. Your clean directory structure is now a mess.

**The conclaude Solution:**
```yaml
# .conclaude.yaml
rules:
  preventRootAdditions: true  # No more mystery files!
```

Claude tries to create a root file ‚Üí conclaude blocks it ‚Üí Claude puts it in the right place.

### Scenario 3: The "Continuous Refactoring" Workflow

**The Vision:**
You're pair programming with Claude for hours, making incremental improvements. You want validation after every change, not just at the end.

**The Setup:**
```yaml
# .conclaude.yaml
stop:
  infinite: true
  run: |
    bun x tsc --noEmit
    bun test --silent
  infiniteMessage: "üõ°Ô∏è Monitoring active - your code stays clean!"
```

Now every small change gets validated immediately. No surprises at the end of a long session.

## Installation

### From Crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install conclaude
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and build from source
git clone https://github.com/conneroisu/conclaude.git
cd conclaude
cargo build --release

# The binary will be in target/release/conclaude
```

### Nix Flake Installation

```bash
# Use the flake directly
nix run github:conneroisu/conclaude -- --help
```

#### Adding conclaude to your development shell

Add conclaude as a flake input and include it in your development shell:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    conclaude.url = "github:conneroisu/conclaude";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, conclaude, ... }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux"; # or your system
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
    in {
      devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
        packages = [
          conclaude.packages.${system}.default
          # your other packages...
        ];
        
        shellHook = ''
          echo "conclaude available in development environment"
          conclaude --help
        '';
      };
    };
}
```

Then enter the development shell:

```bash
nix develop
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/conneroisu/conclaude.git
cd conclaude

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Install for development
cargo install --path .
```

## Configuration: Your Project's Rulebook

Think of conclaude's configuration as your project's constitution‚Äîthe fundamental rules that govern how Claude Code can interact with your codebase. It's designed to be simple enough to set up in minutes, yet powerful enough to handle complex enterprise workflows.

### How Configuration Works

conclaude finds your rules automatically using [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig), looking for:

1. `.conclaude.yaml` - Your main configuration file (recommended)
2. `.conclaude.yml` - Alternative YAML extension

No complex setup, no environment variables to manage. Just drop a `.conclaude.yaml` file in your project root and you're protected.

### Your First Configuration

Here's what a real-world configuration looks like:

```yaml
# .conclaude.yaml - Your project's guardrails

# Commands that MUST pass before any session ends
stop:
  run: |
    cargo fmt --check     # Code formatting check
    cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Linting with warnings as errors
    cargo test            # All tests must pass
    cargo build           # Successful compilation required
  
# File protection rules
rules:
  preventRootAdditions: true    # Keep project root clean
  uneditableFiles:              # Protect critical files
    - "Cargo.toml"              # Don't modify package manifest
    - "Cargo.lock"              # Lock file is sacred
    - ".env*"                   # Secrets stay secret
    - "target/**"               # Build artifacts
```

**What this accomplishes:**
- üõ°Ô∏è Claude can't break your Rust compilation
- ‚úÖ All tests must pass before session completion  
- üé® Your formatting and linting rules are automatically enforced
- üìÅ No surprise files cluttering your project root
- üîí Critical configuration files stay untouched

### Advanced Scenarios

#### Continuous Monitoring During Long Sessions
```yaml
# Perfect for refactoring sessions or long pair-programming
stop:
  run: |
    cargo check --quiet   # Fast compilation check
    cargo test --quiet     # Silent test execution
  infinite: true           # Validate after every change
  infiniteMessage: "üîç Watching your code quality..."
```

#### Enterprise-Grade Protection
```yaml
# Maximum security for production codebases
stop:
  run: |
    cargo audit              # Security audit
    cargo fmt --check        # Strict formatting
    cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # All clippy warnings as errors
    cargo test --all         # Test all packages
    cargo build --release    # Release build

rules:
  preventRootAdditions: true
  uneditableFiles:
    - "Cargo.toml"
    - "Cargo.lock"
    - ".env*"
    - "target/**"
    - ".github/workflows/**"
    - "src/lib.rs"            # Protect main library entry point
```

### Configuration Reference

The complete configuration schema is defined as Rust structs with serde serialization. Key sections include:

- **stop**: Commands and settings for session termination hooks
- **rules**: File protection and validation rules
- **preToolUse**: Pre-execution validation and controls
- **gitWorktree**: Git integration settings

Generate a complete JSON schema with: `conclaude generate-schema`

## Understanding the Hook System

conclaude taps into Claude Code's lifecycle through strategic intervention points called "hooks." Think of hooks as security checkpoints in your development workflow‚Äîeach one serves a specific purpose in keeping your codebase safe and consistent.

### The Three Critical Moments

#### üö¶ PreToolUse Hook: The Gatekeeper
*Fired the moment before Claude tries to use any tool*

**What it protects against:**
- Claude creating files in your project root (when you prefer organized subdirectories)
- Modifications to protected files like `package.json` or `.env` files
- Any tool usage that violates your project's rules

**Real example:** Claude wants to create `debug.log` in your project root, but your `preventRootAdditions` rule blocks it. Claude adapts and creates `logs/debug.log` instead.

#### üìä PostToolUse Hook: The Observer  
*Fired immediately after Claude completes any tool operation*

**What it enables:**
- Complete audit trail of every change Claude makes
- Performance monitoring (how long did that operation take?)
- Session-specific logging with full context
- Post-processing and validation of tool results

**Real example:** After Claude edits a file, PostToolUse logs exactly what changed, when, and in which session‚Äîgiving you complete traceability.

#### ‚ö° Stop Hook: The Validator (Most Important)
*Fired when Claude thinks the session is complete*

**This is where the magic happens.** The Stop hook is your last line of defense and your quality assurance engine:

- **Runs your validation commands** (lint, test, build, etc.)
- **Blocks session completion** if any check fails  
- **Forces Claude to fix issues** before you see "success"
- **Optional infinite mode** for continuous validation during long sessions

**Real example:** Claude finishes implementing a feature. Stop hook runs your tests, finds 3 failures, blocks completion. Claude sees the errors and fixes them automatically. Only then does the session complete successfully.

### Supporting Cast of Hooks

- **UserPromptSubmit** - Intercept and potentially modify your prompts before Claude sees them
- **SessionStart** - Initialize logging, set up monitoring, prepare your workspace  
- **SubagentStop** - Handle completion of Claude's internal subprocesses
- **Notification** - Process and potentially filter system notifications
- **PreCompact** - Prepare transcripts before they're compressed or archived

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration (`.conclaude.yaml`)

```yaml
# Commands to run during Stop hook
stop:
  run: |
    cargo check
    cargo test
    cargo build

# Validation rules
rules:
  # Block file creation at repository root
  preventRootAdditions: true
  
  # Files that cannot be edited (glob patterns)
  uneditableFiles:
    - "Cargo.toml"
    - "Cargo.lock"
    - ".env*"
    - "target/**"
```

### Development Configuration Example

```yaml
# Minimal checks for development
stop:
  run: |
    echo "Running development checks..."
    cargo check

rules:
  preventRootAdditions: false  # Allow root edits during development
  uneditableFiles:
    - "Cargo.toml"  # Still protect Cargo.toml
```

### Production Configuration Example

```yaml
# Comprehensive validation for production
stop:
  run: |
    echo "Running production validation..."
    cargo fmt --check
    cargo clippy -- -D warnings
    cargo test
    cargo build --release

rules:
  preventRootAdditions: true
  uneditableFiles:
    - "Cargo.toml"
    - "Cargo.lock"
    - ".env*"
    - "target/**"
```

### Infinite Mode Configuration Example

```yaml
# Continuous monitoring with infinite mode
stop:
  run: |
    echo "Starting continuous monitoring..."
    cargo check
    cargo test
  infinite: true
  infiniteMessage: "Monitoring active - press Ctrl+C to stop"

rules:
  preventRootAdditions: false  # Allow file changes during development
  uneditableFiles:
    - "Cargo.toml"
```

## Usage

### Claude Code Integration

conclaude is designed to be used as a hook handler in Claude Code. After global installation, use the `conclaude init` command to automatically configure Claude Code hooks:

```bash
# Initialize conclaude in your project
conclaude init
```

This creates:
- `.conclaude.yaml` - Your project configuration
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code hook configuration

#### Manual Claude Code Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, configure hooks in your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "conclaude PreToolUse"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "conclaude PostToolUse"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "conclaude Stop"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Initialize Configuration

```bash
# Create initial .conclaude.yaml configuration
conclaude init

# Force overwrite existing configuration
conclaude init --force

# Specify custom paths
conclaude init --config-path ./custom.yaml --claude-path ./.claude-custom
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test Stop hook
echo '{"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/tmp/test.jsonl","hook_event_name":"Stop","stop_hook_active":true}' | \
  conclaude Stop

# Test PreToolUse hook  
echo '{"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/tmp/test.jsonl","hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"test.txt"}}' | \
  conclaude PreToolUse

# Get help
conclaude --help
conclaude Stop --help
```

### Exit Codes

- **0**: Success - operation allowed to proceed
- **1**: Error - validation failure, parsing error, or handler crash
- **2**: Blocked - hook explicitly blocked the operation

## Hook Behavior Examples

### Stop Hook Command Execution

The Stop hook executes commands from `config.stop.run` sequentially:

```bash
# Configuration
stop:
  run: |
    cargo check
    cargo test

# Execution: If any command fails, the entire hook fails and blocks the session
‚úì Command 1/2: cargo check
‚úó Command 2/2: cargo test (exit code 1)
‚ùå Hook blocked: Command failed with exit code 1: cargo test
```

### PreToolUse Root Protection

When `preventRootAdditions: true`, file-modifying tools are blocked at repo root:

```bash
# Blocked operations
Write ‚Üí /repo/newfile.txt          ‚ùå Blocked
Edit ‚Üí /repo/config.json           ‚ùå Blocked

# Allowed operations  
Write ‚Üí /repo/.gitignore           ‚úì Allowed (dotfile)
Write ‚Üí /repo/src/component.rs     ‚úì Allowed (subdirectory)
Read ‚Üí /repo/Cargo.toml            ‚úì Allowed (read-only)
```

```

### Configuration Loading

Configuration is loaded using native Rust YAML parsing with automatic directory tree search:

1. `.conclaude.yaml` - Primary configuration file
2. `.conclaude.yml` - Alternative YAML extension

The search starts from the current directory and moves up the directory tree until a configuration file is found or the project root (indicated by `package.json` presence) is reached.

If no configuration file is found, conclaude will display the searched locations and suggest running `conclaude init` to generate a template configuration.

### Adding New Hooks

1. Define payload struct in `src/types.rs`
2. Add handler function in `src/hooks.rs`
3. Create command variant in `src/main.rs`
4. Register command with clap CLI parser

## Architecture

### Hook Processing Flow

```
stdin JSON ‚Üí read_payload_from_stdin() ‚Üí validate_base_payload() ‚Üí handler() ‚Üí HookResult ‚Üí exit code
```

### Configuration Resolution

```
.conclaude.yaml ‚Üí serde_yaml parsing ‚Üí ConclaudeConfig struct
```

### Command Execution (Stop Hook)

```
config.stop.run ‚Üí extract_bash_commands() ‚Üí tokio::process::Command ‚Üí sequential execution ‚Üí fail fast
```
