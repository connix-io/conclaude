# Feature Specification: Grep-based Prompt System Level Enforcement

**Feature Branch**: `001-grep-prompt-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "grep-prompt-system-level-enforcement - Allow for grepping of prompt pre submission and conditional inclusion of context/prompts. For example:
```yaml name=\".conclaude.yaml\"
...
prePromptSubmission:
    ufc: 
        - pattern: 'sidebar'
          prompt: >|
          Make sure to read @.claude/contexts/sidebar.md
```"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a CLI tool user, I want the system to automatically analyze my prompt content before submission and conditionally include relevant context or prompts based on pattern matching, so that I receive more targeted and contextually appropriate responses without having to manually specify context each time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user submits a prompt containing the word "sidebar", **When** the system processes the prompt pre-submission, **Then** it should automatically include the context from `.claude/contexts/sidebar.md`
2. **Given** a user submits a prompt that doesn't match any configured patterns, **When** the system processes the prompt, **Then** it should proceed normally without adding additional context
3. **Given** multiple patterns match the user's prompt, **When** the system processes the prompt, **Then** it should include all matching context prompts in the appropriate order
4. **Given** a configuration file with prePromptSubmission rules exists, **When** the system starts up, **Then** it should load and validate all pattern-prompt pairs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a referenced context file doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle malformed regex patterns in the configuration?
- What occurs when the combined prompt + context exceeds system limits?
- How are conflicting or duplicate context prompts handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan user prompts for configured patterns before submission
- **FR-002**: System MUST support regex && glob pattern matching for prompt content analysis (regex: and glob: respectively)
- **FR-003**: System MUST conditionally include context prompts when patterns match
- **FR-004**: System MUST read configuration from `.conclaude.yaml` file in prePromptSubmission section
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple pattern-prompt pairs per configuration
- **FR-006**: System MUST support referencing external context files using @ syntax
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve original user prompt while appending matched context
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate configuration file format and patterns on startup
- **FR-010**: System MUST process patterns in order of appearance in configuration file

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Pattern Rule**: Contains regex pattern and associated prompt/context to include
- **Configuration Entry**: Groups multiple pattern rules under a named category (e.g., "ufc")
- **Context Reference**: Points to external files containing prompt context using @ syntax
- **Processed Prompt**: The final prompt combining user input with matched context
